                Bora Renovations is a professional
                licensed and insured family-owned and operated kitchen cabinet refinishing company located in
                Wilmington, DE. Kitchen cabinet refinishing is the only service we offer. We invest the necessary time
                in thorough prep, use high-quality factory-grade products, and deliver a factory-like, guaranteed
                finish. We don't use rollers and brushes. The entire kitchen (the base, doors) we spray with a
                professional HVLP sprayer which produces a surface that cannot be achieved by any other tool. We call
                our
                company “The best kitchen cabinet refinishing” based on the number of five-star reviews left by our
                previous customers on &nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"
